Traditional Rock, Paper, Scissors game with a simple GUI. This is my first official published project incorporating JavaScript, HTML, and CSS together. I have learned a lot during this process, specifically how to incorporate functions and how they can be made to call one another (known as Callbacks). 

EventListeners were used to take note of interactions with the games buttons. I learnt about looping through HTML elements using the forEach method and combining it with an EventListener in order to be able to to click on any of the 3 buttons. 

The computer needed to generate a random choice of either rock, paper, or scissors. This was done by learning how to generate a random number within a certain upperlimit. This number could then be used in conditional statements to return a choice made by the computer.

Despite being a very basic project I really enjoyed the project and I am proud of all the moments I got stuck and was able to find a solution (albeit, with the help of google many times). I am looking forward to be able to build off of these skills moving forward and create bigger and more ambitious projects.
